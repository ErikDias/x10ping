  "body": "### Supported X10 hardware:\r\n Currently the following X10 hardware is supported: CM11A/C12U, JDS Startgate/TimeCommander/TimeCommnader-Plus and also any device supported by ActiveHome Interface (CM15, CM19A, VT37A, etc). However, you will need to have ActiveHome installed if you plan to use any of the cm15-etc enumerated above.  \r\n\r\n### What is x10ping and why use it?\r\n Have you ever had a network device such as a router, DSL modem, pc, etc. which will hang every now and then? The nonly way to get it up and running is to powercycle it? To make it worst it happens when you are away?\r\nx10ping is your answer.\r\n \r\nNote: With this application you will also need an X10 controller such as CM11A(US)/CM12U(Europe) and x10 appliances  as needed.\r\n \r\n### Get started:\r\n   Download the binary installation package from here and install it. Currently supported platforms are Windows 98, 2000 and XP. It could work on other windows distributions however I didn't test on it. Also the source code is written platform independent (with wxWidgets) and could probably be compiled on other platforms such as Linux and MacOS.\r\n \r\nAfter you completed the installation, start the x10ping application.\r\n\r\n![x10ping main](http://larryo.org/work/information/x10ping/index_files/image002.jpg)\r\n\r\n",
